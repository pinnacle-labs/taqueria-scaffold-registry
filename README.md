# Taqueria Scaffold Registry

This is a registry of scaffolds available to be created using `taq new` command of the Taqueria Project.

## How to add a scaffold to the registry?

Create a PR and modify **registry.json** to include the scaffold to the registry. We will review the PR and accept it if your scaffold is defined correctly.
